# <p align="center">Welcome to Cortex Parse Prefetch</p>
  
This project is an fork of w10 prefetch (https://github.com/bromiley/tools/blob/master/win10_prefetch/w10pf_parse.py).

During the forensic stages, it is not uncommon to retrieve the prefetch files used to find the times of the last executions of software present on a Windows system.


The cortex analyzer automates the extraction of data contained in a PF_DATA file.

We can run the parser from thehive or directly in cortex, or even run the script on its own.
    
## 🧐 Features
